# machine-learning-courseworks

This repository includes 2 group projecta i participated in Imperial College London for the course "Introduction to Machine Learning". 
We implemented the Decision Tree algorithm from scratch and then used it in a specific scenario to determine one of the indoor locations based on WIFI signal strengths collected from a mobile phone. Furthermore, implemented a pruning method ("If a single leaf reduces or does not change the validation error, then the node is pruned and replaced by a single leaf") to enhance the performance on unseen data and finally we evaluated the results' of our models.
The second coursework is about Artificial Neural Networks that includes 2 parts. Firstly, we had to create a neural network mini-library (low-level implementation) of a multi-layered neural network, including a basic implementation of the backpropagation algorithm and implementing necessary functions for data preprocessing, training and evaluation. Also, we used PyTorch to create and train a neural network for regression and experimented with different architectures and we implemented an extensive hyperparameter tuning.
