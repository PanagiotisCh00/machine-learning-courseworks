# DecisionTree
This repository includes a group project i participated in Imperial College London for the course "Introduction to Machine Learning". We implemented the Decision Tree algorithm from scratch and then used it in a specific scenario to determine one of the indoor locations based on WIFI signal strengths collected from a mobile phone. Furthermore, implemented a pruning method ("If a single leaf reduces or does not change the validation
error, then the node is pruned and replaced by a single leaf") to enhance the performance on unseen data and finally we evaluated the results' of our models.
